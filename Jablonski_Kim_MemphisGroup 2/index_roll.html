         The objective of this project was to choose a new startup company and develop a cohesive and captivating brand identity. The company that I worked with was called ‘See Me Rollin’, a Thai rolled ice cream truck based in Austin, Texas. While food trucks are a common trend, the rolled ice cream was a new to the US. By combining aspect of traditional Thai tapestry and bringing in eye-catching colors I was able to create a brand that related to the roots of the unique rolled ice cream while still staying relevant in the food truck trends.

         The brand has a main logo, word mark and also a secondary logo. To stay true to the Thai aspect of the project I also created <br>and implemented patterns to be used as well.
