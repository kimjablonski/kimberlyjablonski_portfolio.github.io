        <h1>Accused!</h1>
        <h2>educational board game</h2>

       <p id="gradient">
         The objective during this project was to create an educational, fun and totally new game. This was a group project in which I worked with three other people including two interior designers, another graphic designer.
         <br><br>
         Working as a team we created Accused!, a board game based on the Salem Witch Trials. After doing heavy research, we carefully created characters based off or real people who were accused and/or executed during the trials. Each character was complete with factual information about what they were accused of and if /how they were executed.
         <br><br>
         Gameplay: Throughout the game players roam around the board collecting Charge cards (accusations), Evidence cards (such as owning a voo doo doll), and trail cards. When a player lands on a trail space they can choose to either go to trial against the player of their choice or to pass up their turn. If the trial goes on, the players use their collected cards to try and accuse one another. Each card has a positive or negative credibility value associated with it. The rest of the players decide who is guiltier, just as the trials would have gone. The last player to stay alive and have the most credibility wins.
