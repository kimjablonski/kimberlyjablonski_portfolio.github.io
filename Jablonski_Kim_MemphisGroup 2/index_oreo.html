                    The goal of this project was to create an exhibition revolving around the history and brand that Oreo portrays. The exhibition is meant to tell the story Oreo, when it was created and its journey and transitions along the way. The exhibition is informative and talks about: the unique facts, such as each Oreo being exactly 71% wafer and 29% cream filling, the journey of the advertising, and transformation of the packaging. It features well known tool used by the public to make eating Oreos easier. Included in the ‘Milk’s Favorite Cookie’ is a personality quiz, a wall of the top 10 ways people eats Oreos and what that says about your personality. There is a flavor wall showing all flavors and a cookie bar with milk on tap where guests can choose from several flavors to try or take home. The exhibition ‘Milk’s Favorite Cookie’ hints at Oreo, and the experience immerses viewer into the unique, quirky and consistent brand that Oreo is known for.
