        <h1>Highlight Posters</h1>

         Collage and photo manipulations were among the first things
           <br>I learned to do when getting into design and using photoshop. I’ve created many versions for many reasons since I started in junior high, but this collection of fellow athletes is easily my favorite. The ones featured here were senior athletes at University of Wisconsin – Stout. I created these posters as a highlight of their careers, and for them to look back on and cherish.  I started with the softball team, which I was a member of, then was asked by several other teams to create them for other athletes. As for printing, I experimented with several methods: cardstock, printer paper mounted on foam core and also worked with a sign company to get them printed on aluminum.
