					 <p id="gradient">
             The objective of this project was to rebrand and create a wayfinding system for the School of Art & Design at UW-Stout. The previous system lacked clarity and a cohesive brand for the school and was quite confusing for guests and new students to find their way around. The rooms numbers are scattered and out of order.
             <br><br>
             In order to create a successful wayfinding system, I <br>started by creating the branding system and categorized important labs and bathrooms, so they would stand out. The brand identity included a logo, word mark, 4 color system and distinct triangular symbol. The wayfinding system included floor layouts and maps at the entries, lab and bathroom color coded signs, and room sign that could easily be seen while walking down the hall and smaller door signs.
